<h1>Performance guidelines</h1>
This document contains some performance guidelines that should be understood while developing
for the Multiverse project.
<ol>
    <li><b>Don't pay for what you don't use:</b>
        in some cases extra code is added to deal with certain functionality like
        profiling or logging. This added functionality should not reduce the performance
        of the STM when it is deactivated. Making effective use of dead code removal
        executed by the JIT is one of the ways to make this possible. Another example
        is creating different update-transaction implementations for specific transaction
        lengths. This could replace an expensive map structure, by a much cheaper
        array. For certain length the fixed-length array will outperform the map.
    </li>
    <li><b>Watch out for object creation in frequent executed loops:</b> although the
        new garbage collectors have improved over the years quite a lot, object creation
        still can slow down the performance of some operation if millions of objects are
        created per second.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>volatile reads are cheap compared to volatile writes:</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>arrays are you friend:</b> although they are seen as old school, they still
        are very valuable. There are a few advantages like easy to process elements of
        the array in parallel, there are also other advantages like a decreased size
        of memory compared to a linkedlist and it also reduced object creation overhead.
        To store 10 items in a linkedlist, you need to create at least 10 listnode objects, and
        with an array you only need a single object.
    </li>
</ol>
