- a better performing defaultprofiler (remove the concurrenthashmap)

- easier way to do the actual logging, you don't want to have it scattered all over the code itself. Perhaps

- track on class level where writeconflicts happen

- track on class level where the locks could not be acquired.

- make it easy to calculate percentages.
