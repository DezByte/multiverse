TODO

- system should be able to do something with multiple measures

- system should be able to easily combine multiple graphs

- system should be able to place error information in the output

- system is only able to deal with 1 line on the graph

- system should be able to deal with different types than just integers

- user should be able to benchmark from the command line

- user should be able to create diagrams from the benchmark

- user should be able to set the title from the command line

- user should be able to set the name of the output png from the commandline

- user should be able to create the complete benchmark in ant? groovy? Not having to program

- user should be able to start different jvm's for executing the tests so that different parameters
can be used. For example g1 garbage collector or pointer compression.

- at the moment each driver need to extract the testcase parameters, this can
be automated using reflection.

- during execution you want to see where you are.. current testcase index/total testcases.

- atm it is not possible to see which testresults belong to each other and which not.
    - you can't see if attempts belong to each other
    - you can't see of testresults for differenttestcases but the same benchmark
    belong to each other.


DONE

- 2 lines should be drawn in the diagram

- the content of the test

- the directory needs to be created consistent
