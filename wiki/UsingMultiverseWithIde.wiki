#summary Using Multiverse inside an IDE

= Introduction =

Multiverse has 2 special needs because it relies on instrumentation (bytecode manipulation):
  * boot.jar need to be set on the bootclasspath. This jars only contains a special classloader that allows the addition of new classes.
  * the multiverse agent needs to be set as javaagent. 
This page describes how to set up IntelliJ, Eclipse and Netbeans for Multiverse and also how to set it up from the commandline.
