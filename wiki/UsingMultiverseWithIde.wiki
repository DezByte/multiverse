#summary Using Multiverse inside an IDE

= Introduction =

Multiverse has 2 special needs because it relies on instrumentation (bytecode manipulation):
  * boot.jar need to be set on the bootclasspath. This jars only contains a special classloader that allows the addition of new classes.
  * the multiverse agent needs to be set as javaagent. 
This page describes how to set up IntelliJ, Eclipse and Netbeans for Multiverse.
