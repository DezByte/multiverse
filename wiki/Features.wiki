#summary Overview of the (planned) features of Multiverse

= Features =
  * multi version concurrency control (the same mechanism Oracle, Postgresql and other databases use).
  * no overhead on reads/writes of object fields that point to primitives or non stm objects. Instead of working with a transaction log, the object is checked for changes when the commit happens.
  * small overhead (for lazy loading purposes) on non final stm references
  * special optimisations for immutable stm structures so that loading gets really cheap (O(c)) no matter the size of the structure.
  * non managed stm objects can flow through stm space (for example for handing over an object from one thread to another).
  * transaction level read consistency (the same isolation Oracle provides, so not 100% serialized)

= Planned =
  * Pessimistic locking & deadlock detection 
  * Instrumentation of pojo's. 
  * Annotation driven transaction instead of the current template driven version
  * A lot of statistics
